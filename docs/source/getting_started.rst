Directory Structure
--------------------

The following files and sub-directories will be found:

* **COPYRIGHT** - Please get familiar with the Copyright before using this code!
* **README** - Explains how to obtain, install and update the code.
* **doc/** - Provides additional documentation, including this user guide.
* **examples/** - Provides a careful set of examples that are known to work.
* **f90/** - The code base, makefiles and configuration scripts.
* **matlab/** - Auxiliary Matlab scripts for file conversion, and others.

Compiling ModEM
---------------

The f90 directory contains several prototype makefiles, as well as some configuration
scripts (``****.config``) that can be used for creating makefiles. These configuration scripts
are primarily useful after substantial code modifications, and most users will not have
cause (or for that matter, any desire) to use these scripts. For almost all purposes you
can use the provided makefiles, perhaps with some minor editing. There are several
makefile variants for both 2D and 3D MT. For example, Makefile3d for compiling a serial
version of the code, and ``Makefile3d.MPI`` for a parallel version. Follow these instructions
carefully when modifying Makefiles! Copy the makefile before editing, to avoid conflict
with standard versions in the svn archive, i.e.::
    
    cd f90; cp Makefile.gnu Makefile

Then open the copy of the Makefile in your favorite editor, and make sure that the
(uncommented) compiler is set appropriately for your system). Some paths may also
need to be modified. The make command will compile the 3D MT (or 2D MT) code for
you (Mod3DMT and Mod2DMT, respectively).

ModEM can be compiled for a parallel or serial execution. Make sure that you use the
appropriate compiler preprocessing flag to compile the desired MPI (parallel) or serial
version. Also make sure that the MPICH library is already installed on your machine, if
you want to compile for MPI version. Here are examples of the compiler preprocessing
flag and directive used to compile the MPI version:

* PGI compiler: -Mpreprocess —> Serial; -Mpreprocess -DMPI —> Parallel
* Intel compiler: -fpp —> Serial; -fpp -DMPI —> Parallel
* GFortran: -cpp-input —> Serial; -cpp-input -DMPI —> Parallel

Creating Makefiles from Configuration Files
-------------------------------------------

The current build system for ModEM uses the `fmkmf.pl` pearl script and the
configuration scripts that are in `f90/CONFIG`. Although ModEM uses Make and
Makefiles, makefiles are meant to be created by these configuration scripts.

To create Makefiles, run the configuration scripts that match your system,
desired compiler and desired ModEM version. These configuration scripts
call the `fmkmf.pl` script::

    $ cd f90/
    $ ./CONFIG/Configure Makefile gfortran

The Configure scripts has the following usage::

    $ Usage: ./CONFIG/Configure [-h] [-u] [-g release|debug] [-m mpi|serial] [-l solver] [-f] makefile-name compiler
        -h Display full help message
        -u Display this usage message
        -g <release | debug> Specify whether to build with debug symbols or not
            release - Default - Create Makefile with full optimizations (i.e. -O3)
            debug   - Create Makefile with debug symbols (i.e. -g) and no optimizations
        -m <mpi* | serial> Specify MPI or serial
            mpi - Default - Builds with MPI
            serial - Builds Serially
        -l <MF | SP | SP2> Specify solver
            MF - Builds with MF
            SP - Builds with SP
            SP2 - Default - Builds with SP2
        -f Build with Fined-Grained -DFG on SP2
            Only able to build with SP2
        -s Build spherical version of ModEM

Examples using Configure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A few examples using Configure::

    $ ./CONFIG/Configure Makefile gfortran                                                      
    Generates a Makefile with GFortran options using MPI                          
                                              
    $ ./CONFIG/Configure -d debug Makefile gfortran
    Generates an MPI Makefile with GFortran debugging options
                                              
    $ ./CONFIG/Configure -m serial -l MF Makefile gfortran
    Generates a serial Makefile with GFortran with the MF solver

Compiling
----------

Once you have generated your own makefile, or decided to use one of the
defaults, you can compile ModEM by renaming that makefile to Makefile and then
run make

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cp Makefile.3D.MF.gnu Makefile
    $ make clean # Not necessary from a fresh clone
    $ make


Compiling with MPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have MPI installed, and already have a serial makefile generated you can
easily compile the MPI version of ModEM by altering the makefile. This is
sometimes easier then creating a new makefile from the configuration scripts.

To compile an MPI version, edit the compiler in your makefile to be an MPI
compiler (e.g. mpifort) and add -DMPI to the MPIFLAGGS variable

.. code-block:: Makefile

    F90 = mpifort
    MPIFLAGS = -DMPI ... omitting other flags

However, you can also generate an MPI makefile by running the configuration
scripts and passing it MPI as the type.

..important::

    When running ModEM with MPI you must use at least 2 tasks and
    a max of (2 x nTransmitters) + 1 tasks (except for the SP2 version compiled
    with -DFG).

Running ModEM: The basics
-------------------------

Running the compiled program with no command line arguments will print a brief
summary of usage

.. code-block:: text

    Output information to files, and progress report to screen (default).
    Usage: Mod3DMT -[job] [args]

    [READ_WRITE]
        -R rFile_Model rFile_Data [wFile_Model wFile_Data]
        Reads your input files and checks them for validity;
        optionally also writes them out
    [FORWARD]
        -F rFile_Model rFile_Data wFile_Data [wFile_EMsoln rFile_fwdCtrl]
        Calculates the predicted data and saves the EM solution
    [COMPUTE_J]
        -J rFile_Model rFile_Data wFile_Sens [rFile_fwdCtrl]
        Calculates and saves the full J(acobian)
    [MULT_BY_J]
        -M rFile_Model rFile_dModel rFile_Data wFile_Data [rFile_fwdCtrl]
        Multiplies a model by J to create a data vector
    [MULT_BY_J_T]
        -T rFile_Model rFile_Data wFile_dModel [rFile_fwdCtrl]
        Multiplies a data vector by J^T to create a model
    [INVERSE]
        -I NLCG rFile_Model rFile_Data [lambda eps]
        Here, lambda = the initial damping parameter for inversion
            eps = misfit tolerance for the forward solver
        OR
        -I NLCG rFile_Model rFile_Data [rFile_invCtrl rFile_fwdCtrl]
        Optionally, may also supply
            the model covariance configuration file [rFile_Cov]
            the starting model parameter perturbation [rFile_dModel]
        Runs an inverse search to yield an inverse model at every iteration
    [TEST_COV]
        -C rFile_Model wFile_Model [rFile_Cov]
        Applies the model covariance to produce a smooth model output
    [TEST_ADJ]
        -A J rFile_Model rFile_dModel rFile_Data [wFile_Model wFile_Data]
        Tests the equality d^T J m = m^T J^T d for any model and data.
        Optionally, outputs J m and J^T d.
    [TEST_SENS]
        -S rFile_Model rFile_dModel rFile_Data wFile_Data [wFile_Sens]
        Multiplies by the full Jacobian, row by row, to get d = J m.
        Compare to the output of [MULT_BY_J] to test [COMPUTE_J]

    Optional final argument -v [debug|full|regular|compact|result|none]
    indicates the desired level of output to screen and to files.


The ``-F [FORWARD]`` and ``-I [INVERSE]`` options will suffice for simple applications. For
some of the more advanced applications discussed below the ``-C [TEST_COV]`` option is
also needed. The ``-R [READ_WRITE]`` option can be useful for testing whether your input
files are in the correct format. The ``-v`` option controls the level of program output; the
default is “regular”; if you want to reduce outputs (“none” is *not recommended!*) you can
experiment with other output levels; “full ” and “debug” would be primarily useful for
developers. All of the other options (``-J``, ``-M``, etc.) are primarily useful for development,
testing, and some specialized applications that are beyond the scope of this
basic documentation.

Sub-directory ``examples/`` contains some sample input files with instructions for simple
cases. These should be sufficient to test your installation, and also will provide a tem-
plate for your own initial use. The ``doc/`` sub-directory contains some further information
on the ModEM system, beyond the summary of usage provided here.

All of the various options have a required set of arguments, which define input and
output file names (``rFile``, and ``wFile`` in the usage summary, respectively). There are
also optional arguments, mostly also specifying additional input or output file names.
In all cases the order of arguments must be exactly as indicated in the “Usage” block,
so to give an optional argument at the end of the list, all previous optional arguments
must also be provided. Thus, for example, with the ``-F`` option, if you want to specify the
input ``rFile_fwdCtrl`` file, you must also specify the output ``wFile_EMsoln`` file, even if
you do not specifically want the full set of output EM fields, which this option will result
in. Before providing a more detailed discussion of the various options, we consider file
formats.

Using Docker to Compile and Run ModEM
-------------------------------------

A `Dockerfile <Dockerfile_>`_ has been provided that will create an Ubuntu docker
container where you can compile and run ModEM. To run the ModEM docker
container, first ensure you have `docker installed <Docker-Getting-Started_>`_ and
running (Either have the docker daemon `docker running <daemon-running_>`_, or Docker
`Desktop Running <Docker-desktop_>`_.

The Dockerfile builds an Ubuntu instance with GFortran, MPI, and all the other
tools needed to compile and run ModEM.

Building
^^^^^^^^

After you install Docker, you will need to build the docker container. Inside
the ``ModEM`` directory (where the ``Dockerfile`` resides), run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker build . -t modem:latest --build-arg ncpus=2

You can specify different numbers of arguments in the ``ncpus`` build argument if
you wish. It will speed up the time when Docker compiles MPICH.

.. important::

    For personal machines, it's best to set ``ncpus`` no greater than the max number of
    cores on your machines.

    For shared login nodes you may want to use no more than 2-4 CPUs in order to
    not detrement other users.

After running the above command Docker will create an image named
``modem:latest`` that you can then use to run; it will have all necessary
libraries and compilers to compile and run ModEM.

.. note::

    It can take anywhere from 3-15 minutes to build the ModEM docker image,
    depending on how fast your CPU is and how many CPUs you specify in
    ``ncpus``.

Running and building ModEM in Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the dockerfile automatically checks out the ``main`` branch of ModEM
and places it in the root user's home directory: ``/root/ModEM-main``. This copy
of ModEM has been provided for the convience of new users.

First, let us start a container using the image that we built above:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker volume create modem
    $ docker run -it -v modem:/root/ModEM-main modem:latest

Normally, when running a docker container, the data created inside the container
will be deleted when the container terminates. To prevent this, we can use a
volume. 

First, we need to create a named volume using ``docker volume create modem``, then
in our run command we attach that volume to ``/root/ModEM-main``. This will save any
data that we created inside ``/root/ModEM-main``, but nowhere else.

After you terminate that container, and wish to start it again, you will need to
specify your run command with the same arguments as above to reuse the data
inside the volume, see important note below.

The docker run command will run the image ``modem:latest`` and create a
container for us to use The ``-it`` argument will tell Docker to start an
interactive tty session and will drop you inside the running container.

Now, we can move into ``~/ModEM-main`` to configure, build and run ModEM:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ~/ModEM-main
    $ cd f90/
    $ # Compile with MPI, SP2 solver:
    $ ./CONFIG/configure Makefile gfortran
    $ # or compile serial, SP2 solver
    $ ./CONFIG/configure -m serial Makefile gfortran
    $ make
    $ # Run ModEM serially or with MPI:
    $ mpiexec -n 2 ./Mod3DMT ...
    $ # Or if you compiled serial:
    $ ./Mod3DMT ...


You can terminate this docker session by logging out by typing ``exit`` or you can
use ``Ctrl-D``.

.. important::

    Again, if you want to re-run docker and reuse the files/folders/data you
    created before you will need to specify the volume that you used before

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ docker run -it -v modem:/root/ModEM-main modem:latest

.. warning::

    Any data you create outside of the ``ModEM-main`` directory will not be
    saved. If you want to save data you will need to specify additional volumes
    or mounts. See :ref:`docker-mounts`.

    For more information on persistant data see:

    https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/persisting-container-data/

.. _docker-mounts:

Specifying mounts points
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: 

    For more information on Docker mounts see:
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/.

While it is helpful to have the ``ModEM-Main/`` provided, it is also helpful to
work with local version of ``ModEM`` you have on your host system. To do that we
can use mounts, which will allow us to mirror a directory on our host system
into the container.

We can add a mount by passing in a ``--mount`` option during our run command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run --mount=type=bind,source=/abosolute/path/to/ModEM,target=/root/ModEM -it modem:latest

The above command will run the container in the same way as above, but it will
mount ``/abosolute/path/to/ModEM/`` from your host system to ``/root/ModEM`` to
the container. Any changes you make in this folder, in either the container or
the host machine will be present on the other machine.

It might be helpful to specify additional mount points, for instance it might
be helpful to mount a work directory, such as the ModEM-Examples repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run --mount=type=bind,source=/abosolute/path/to/ModEM,target=/root/ModEM \
                 --mount=type=bind,source=/home/users/uname/ModEM-Examples,target=/root/ModEM-Examples \
                 -it modem

.. _daemon-running: https://docs.docker.com/engine/daemon/start/
.. _docker-Getting-Started: https://www.docker.com/get-started/
.. _dockerfile: https://github.com/magnetotellurics/ModEM/blob/main/Dockerfile

.. important::

    Again, each time you run your modem container, you will need to specify
    volume and mount points.
