ModEM Branches
---------------

As noted in the README, there are several branches on ModEM which have been
converted from ModEM's OSU CEOAS Subversion (SVN) repository. Likewise, there
are some specific branches worth noting.


Main and Develop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `main branch <https://github.com/magnetotellurics/ModEM>`_ of ModEM holds
the latest release of ModEM and contains code that has been more used and
more thoroughly tested and is more stable then develop.

The `develop branch <https://github.com/magnetotellurics/ModEM/tree/develop>`_
on the other hands contains the latest code changes the ModEM. While these
features are new, they may not be as stable as they have not undergone
significant testing and usage and may contain bugs or be incomplete.

SVN Branches

The complete SVN history has been preserved and converted into a git history.
