Installing ModEM Dependencies
=============================

Installing MPI
--------------

There are two widely used versions of MPI which we recommend using with ModEM:

* MPICH - https://www.mpich.org/
* OpenMPI - https://www.open-mpi.org/

Both have been tested thoroughly with ModEM. Both offer benefits over the
other, but such discussion is beyond the scope of this document. Installing
both is relatively similar, but for brevity we will only give instructions on
installing MPICH.

Linux
^^^^^^

If you are on a Linux system, and have sudo powers, it is probably easiest to
install MPICH using your package manager:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Debian/Ubuntu
    $ apt install openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev 

    # Fedora/RHEL/Centos
    $ yum install mpich

.. note::

    Installing with a Linux package manager requires root (``sudo``) powers,
    thus the above commands will not work on a shared system where you do not
    have powers to use ``sudo``.

If you are on a shared system, or you do not have sudo powers, you can follow
the instructions to compile MPICH by hand in :ref:`mpich-by-hand`.

MacOS
^^^^^^

For MacOSX, you can easily install MPICH using Homebrew:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ brew install mpich

See: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mpich
Or for OpenMPI: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/open-mpi

.. _mpich-by-hand: 

Compiling MPICH from source 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. tip::

    More information on installing MPICH (or OpenMPI) can be found in
    the README or INSTALL files of their source code.

It is relatively easy to install MPICH (and OpenMPI) by hand if you need to do
so. To do so, you will only need to a C, C++, and Fortran compiler available on
your system.

First, download the tar file from the MPICH website and then untar it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wget https://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/5.0.0b1/mpich-5.0.0b1.tar.gz
    $ tar -xzvf mpich-5.0.0b1.tar.gz

Then, create a new, empty, directory inside your home directory, this is where
we will install our files to:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ~/
    $ mkdir installs

We will use the ``installs`` directory to install MPI, and the LAPACK and
BLAS (as described below).

Change directory into the MPICH directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd mpich-5.0.0b1

Then, we can run the ``configure`` inside the mpich directory. Here, we will
specify our C compiler and Fortran compiler (although they are often detected
by default):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ CC=gcc FC=gfortran ./configure --prefix=/home/<USERNAME>/installs

In the line above, ``CC`` specifies the C compiler we want to use (to gcc) and
``FC`` sets the Fortran compiler we want to use (gfortran). You can adjust
these to meet your needs.

The ``--prefix`` argument specifies where the include files, library files,
documentation and executables should be placed when we type ``make install``.

Configure will take some time to determine how to build your system, and at the
end, you'll get a message saying that 'MPICH is configured..'. Once it's
configured, we can call ``make`` to compiler it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ # -j4 will Make with 4 threads
    $ make -j4

Here we've used ``-j`` to specify the number of threads to use when compiling,
you can use more, but if you are on a shared system you should respect other
users and use an appropriate amount of threads (4 is generally good).

Once it's compiled, you can run ``make install``, which will install MPICH into
the ``/home/<USERNAME>/installs``

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make -j4 install


Inside ``/home/<USERNAME>/installs`` there will be four new directories:

* ``bin`` - Contains executables such as ``mpifort``, ``mpicc``, ``mpiexec``, ``mpirun`` etc.
* ``etc`` - Contains MPI configuration files
* ``include`` - Contains MPI .h and .mod include files
* ``lib`` - MPI library files
* ``share`` - MPI Documents and manuals ``man mpifort``.

To use our install, we will need to run the executables that are in the
``/home/<USERNAME>/installs/bin`` directory. To do so we can add them to our
PATH variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export PATH=/home/<USERNAME>/install/bin:$PATH

Now we can run ``mpifort`` to compile and ``mpiexec`` to launch MPI
applications.

Installing LAPACK and BLAS
----------------------------

Installing BLAS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While you can install BLAS manually, LAPACK *is* packaged with a copy of BLAS,
so you can skip straight to installing LAPACK: See :ref:`installing-lapack`.


.. _installing-lapack:

Installing LAPACK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. tip::

    More information for installing LAPACK can be found in its README.md file.

Installing LAPACK is very easy. First, download LAPACK from:
https://www.netlib.org/lapack/ and extract it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ # Optionally create an installation folder if you did not do it above:
    $ mkdir installs
    $
    $ # Download and extract LAPACK:
    $ wget https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/archive/refs/tags/v3.12.1.tar.gz
    $ tar -xzvf v3.12.1.tar.gz
    $ cd lapack-3.12.1

For LAPACK, we just need to create a ``make.inc`` file. We simply can use the
provided example ``make.inc.example``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cp make.inc.example make.inc

Open ``make.inc`` and ensure it has correct settings (it should be set for
gcc/gfortran), then call make:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make -j4

This will produce three ``*.a`` files:

* liblapack.a
* librefblas.a
* libtmglib.a

LAPACK does not have an install like MPI, but we can just copy, link or move
them into the installation we made in :ref:`mpich-by-hand`
(``/home/<USERNAME>/installs/lib``). Specifically, we will need to move/link
them into the ``lib`` folder of that directory.

We will also need to change the name of ``librefblas.a`` to ``libblas.a``, as
ModEM tries to link to ``libblas.a``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ln -s liblapack.a /home/<USERNAME>/install/lib/liblapack.a
    $ ln -s librefblas.a /home/<USERNAME>/install/lib/libblas.a


Compiling ModEM with LAPACK/LABLAS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, when we compile ModEM, we can link to these libraries. To do so, we will
need to specify the directory ``lib`` directory above, we can do this in the
``LDFLAGS`` when we run configure:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ModEM/f90
    $ LDFLAGS="-L/home/<USERNAME>/installs/lib" ./CONFIG/configure Makefile gfortran

This will cause your installed LAPACK and BLAS to be linked to ModEM!
